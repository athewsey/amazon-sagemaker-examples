    "R is a popular open source statistical programming language, with a lengthy history in Data Science and Machine Learning.  The breadth of algorithms available as an R package is impressive, which fuels a growing community of users.  The R kernel can be installed into Amazon SageMaker Notebooks, and Docker containers which use R can be used to take advantage of Amazon SageMaker's flexible training and hosting functionality.  This notebook illustrates a simple use case for creating an R container and then using it to train and host a model.  In order to take advantage of boto, we'll use Python within the notebook, but this could be done 100% in R by invoking command line arguments.\n",

This would more fully realize the benefits of managed training."
